Crystal Collector

Crystal collector is game where the user is given 4 crystals with values unknown to them and they try to add the values of the crystals together to match the random number generated by the computer. The user has to be able to remember the value of each crystal and be able to add them mentally in order to not go over the random number which will cause the user to lose.

The game shows how you can build out a basic html file and then use bootstrap to add on some CSS and make the site mobile friendly while also using some javascript and jQuery to manipulate the DOM.

Feel free to take a peek inside and see how it works. If you have any questions about the project feel free to contact me.
